# TMS_Reverse
Reverse endianness of Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE (Encore) save files at selected offsets.

Sections at different offsets can be copied to the output without changes or with every 2/4/8 bytes reversed for the specified region.

It should support Wii U<->Switch conversion once finished, currently stuck on a bootloop with converted saves.
